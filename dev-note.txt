#region Questions to clarify

Is this the minial version of clean architecture yet easily scalable?
I also want to store and get log so that I'm able to trace error and exception when the app is running
What is the best way to design paging solution, so that in the back-end I have a dynamic base paging api endpoint that can handle paging for every entity (of course except some exceptional cases),give me flow from front-end to back-end.
the api endpoint has to be flexible in terms of fields data, master-detail data can be fetched or not based on mode param from front-end (fe),
easily sort data based on multiple field names, search data using  operation with multiple fields combined with search data using OR operation with multiple fields
